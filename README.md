# Snake-Game

This is a simple "Snake Game" by C++, here're the rules:

1. press w to move the snake upward
2. press s to move the snake downward
3. press a to move the snake leftward
4. press d to move the snake rightward
5. press x to end the game
6. the snake can pass through the walls
7. when the head bump into tail, the game will be over
